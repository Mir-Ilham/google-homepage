Introduction
---------------------

This Google homepage replica is my first Web Development project using plain html and css.


Skills gained
---------------------

1) Writing basic html using div,span,img,footer,nav,a tags and form elements using the input tag.

2) Crafting navigation bars using html unordered lists and css styling.

3) Centering div tags using css.

4) Colors in CSS.

5) CSS fonts.


My reflections on the project
--------------------

This project put my problem solving abilities to the test.I was not being hand held throughout.Crafting something up from scratch,staring at the
blank text editor was frustrating.Having finished the project and looking at the final product is very rewarding as I reflect on the hardwork it took.
This project is going to be a stepping stone for my future progress.
